## Introducing Else If statements

_Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program and write your own code._



#### Hint 1
Remember that _equality is different from assignment (`=`), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left._<sup>1</sup>

####  Hint 2

The inequality operator (`!=`) will return `true` if the first value is not equal to the second one without taking value type into consideration.

> _try to solve the problem now_

##  Spoiler alert!

**Solution ahead!**

##  Basic code solution:

```javascript

// Setup

function testNotEqual(val) {

if (val != 99) { // Change this line

return "Not equal";

}

return "Equal";

}

// Change this value to test

testNotEqual(10);

```

###  Code explanation

The function first evaluates `if` the condition `(val != 99)` evaluates to `true`. If it does, it returns the statement between the curly braces ("Not equal"). If it doesn't, it returns the next `return` statement outside them ("Equal").
