## Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions

Again, ES6 is all about making JavaScript more elegant, and for some, more readable. 

Anonymous functions, as stated, can be created when you are sure that the function will not be called by name anywhere else.

## Hint 1:

Get rid of the `function` key word, and plug in this `=>` arrow.

## Hint 2:

Did you get rid of the `var` keyword?

## Spoiler alert - Solution ahead!

## Solution:

```javascript
const magic = () => {
  "use strict";
  return new Date();
};
```
As long as you got rid of the `var` keyword, youâ€™re good.

## Alternative code solution:
```javascript
const magic = () => new Date ();
```

Remember that _"When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword `return` as well as the brackets surrounding the code."_
