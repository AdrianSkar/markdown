## Comparison with the strict inequality operator


### Problem explanation:
Â· _Add the inequality operator `!=` in the `if` statement so that the function will return "Not equal" when `val` is not equivalent to `99`._

#### Hint 1
The inequality operator (`!=`) will return `true` if the first value is not equal to the second one without taking value type into consideration.

## Spoiler alert!

**Solution ahead!**

## Basic code solution:

```javascript
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
  if (val !== 17) {
    return "Not equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testStrictNotEqual(10);
```

### Code explanation
The function first evaluates `if` the condition `(val !== 17)` evaluates to `true` considering both value and value type. If it does, it returns the statement between the curly braces ("Not equal"). If it doesn't, it returns the next `return` statement outside them ("Equal").
