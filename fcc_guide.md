## Comparison with the inequality operator


### Problem explanation:
Â· _Add the inequality operator `!=` in the `if` statement so that the function will return "Not Equal" when `val` is not equivalent to `99`._

#### Hint 1
The "Not Equal" operator (`!=`) will return `true` if the first value is not equal to the second one without taking value type into consideration.

## Spoiler alert!

**Solution ahead!**

## Basic code solution:

```javascript
// Setup
function testNotEqual(val) {
  if (val != 99) { // Change this line
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testNotEqual(10);
```

### Code explanation
The function first evaluates `if` the condition `(a === b)` evaluates to `true` considering both type and value. If it does, it returns the statement between the curly braces ("Equal"). If it doesn't, it returns the next `return` statement outside them ("Not equal").
