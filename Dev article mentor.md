So I'm learning JS on my own and I've found many helpful sites (fCC, MDN, Dev.to...) and tools (Discord, Twitter, git, kanban boards...) but sometimes I get the feeling that I'm trying to find the perfect cherry blossom on a rainy day (not that it gets much easier on sunny ones).

You have tutorials, specs, exercises and it all seems overwhelming while, being an adult, you know that many things are hard to master at first but, unlike driving, many of us don't have an instructor or teacher to rely on and experienced people have even less free time available than us.

So I was wondering... 
What do we do when entities can't provide the resources and means for people to learn something? How do we help a kid learn to ride a bike with no training wheels without being able to be there all the ride?
I've seen many forum threads, groups, servers where we (as far as I'm told) ask the same questions and encounter the same difficulties when learning new programming concepts again and again.

And I wonder... Does this happen less on other fields?
Can people without a teacher or mentor overcome the barrier between documentation/specs and mentorship/classroom?
I've learned about many people trying to make better specs, people making better tools, better learning platforms and all that has brought us with many and more helpful sites and improvements, yet we're often told that one of the best ways to learn is to surround yourself of people that have more experience than you and can teach you something new. 
So, in a field where many of us are "changing" careers and don't have much free time to enjoy a meetup, attend a conference or network ourselves out of our "newbieness", how can we learn to ride a bike with no training wheels? 
Do we fall until we get it? Can we get 5 minutes a day with someone experienced to learn from directly? That doesn't seem much but... Is it fair for us to ask for 30 hours a year of someone's time?

I think we're fortunate to be able to count on so many generous people and entities  that came before us and provide "free" time and resources so we all can get a chance. But, even before I call myself a developer I wonder... Can we go even further and improve our learning process without taking more from our predecessors?
